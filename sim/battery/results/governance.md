# Failure-boundary battery: governance

Build: commit 9ceed47 (with any uncommitted changes at the time).

Run time 7.9 minutes; 24 random rays; 128 screened worlds (severities up to 1.00), 0% failing.

## Limits along one factor (severity 1 = top of the explored range)

| Factor | Fails beyond |
|---|---|
| signal noise | not within 2 |
| ability scatter | not within 2 |
| hidden outcomes | not within 2 |
| local noise | not within 2 |
| collusion | not within 2 |
| delegation | not within 2 |
| loyalty | not within 2 |

## Importance in screening (mean severity in failing worlds less in converging ones)

| Factor | Importance |
|---|---|
| signal noise | 0.000 |
| ability scatter | 0.000 |
| hidden outcomes | 0.000 |
| local noise | 0.000 |
| collusion | 0.000 |
| delegation | 0.000 |
| loyalty | 0.000 |

## Strongest interactions (failure rate when both are high, beyond each alone)

| Pair | Interaction |
|---|---|
| ability scatter × delegation | +0.000 |
| signal noise × delegation | +0.000 |
| ability scatter × collusion | +0.000 |
| hidden outcomes × delegation | +0.000 |
| local noise × delegation | +0.000 |
| signal noise × ability scatter | +0.000 |
| signal noise × hidden outcomes | +0.000 |
| hidden outcomes × local noise | +0.000 |

## Nearest failures on random rays (severity per factor at the boundary)

| t | signal noise | ability scatter | hidden outcomes | local noise | collusion | delegation | loyalty | monotone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Non-monotone rays (converging again beyond the boundary): 0 of 24.
